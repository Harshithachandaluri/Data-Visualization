The primary goal of this project is to leverage Python data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to recreate and extend Hans Rosling's captivating animated graph from his TED talk, "The best stats you've ever seen." 

The central objective of this project is to harness the capabilities of Python data visualization libraries, specifically Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, to craft animated plots that vividly portray trends in life expectancy, fertility rate, and population across diverse countries. The animated visualizations aim to dynamically illustrate the relationships and patterns within the dataset.

**Dataset Information**:


●	`Life expectancy at birth`: The number of years a newborn would live if the patterns of mortality at the time of birth remain the same throughout his life.

●	`Fertility rate`: Number of children a woman would give birth to during her childbearing years. 

●	`Country population`: Total number of residents regardless of legal status or citizenship (midyear estimates)
